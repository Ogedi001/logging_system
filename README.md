# logging_system

## Overview
The Logging System is a robust solution designed to collect, store, and visualize log data. It leverages Elasticsearch as the data store for logs and Grafana as the visualization tool to provide insightful dashboards and analysis. This repository contains the codebase and configuration files required to set up and run the logging system.

## Key Components
### 1. Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch is a powerful, open-source search and analytics engine. In this logging system, it is used as the primary datastore for storing log data. Elasticsearch allows for efficient indexing, querying, and analysis of large volumes of log data.

### 2. Grafana
Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. It provides a rich set of tools to create, explore, and share dashboards, making it easy to visualize the data stored in Elasticsearch. Grafana's flexible query options and interactive visualizations help in gaining deep insights from log data.

### 3. Node.js Backend
The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, providing APIs to ingest and manage log data. The backend communicates with Elasticsearch to index and retrieve logs.
